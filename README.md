# Spatiotemporal-Data-Mining-for-Smart-Cities-A-Case-Study-of-San-Jose-California
📍 Project Overview
This project applies spatiotemporal data mining techniques to analyze OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for San Jose, California.
It demonstrates how smart cities can leverage geographic and temporal datasets to extract meaningful insights for urban planning, healthcare infrastructure, transportation analysis, and amenity distribution.

We focus on:

Buildings and land use

Healthcare facilities (hospitals, clinics)

Road networks (highways, streets)

Public amenities (parks, libraries, etc.)

🛠 Features
Automated Download of OSM data using bounding box or neighborhood names.

Data Cleaning and Centroid Extraction (Latitude and Longitude).

CSV Export of cleaned datasets for easy reusability.

Visualizations:

Building Type Distribution

Healthcare Bed Availability

Amenity Type Distribution

Road Density Heatmaps

Interactive Maps using Folium:

Building Locations

Healthcare Facilities with Bed Counts

Public Amenities

Donut Chart: Top Operators/Organizations managing city infrastructures.
